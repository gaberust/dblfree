<p>Gabe is a self-taught developer who took an interest in programming at age 16, whose interest quickly became a passion.
            As he grew more familiar with web development in particular,
            web application security and safely handling untrusted user input caught his attention.
            He has been studying development since 2015 and information security since 2018.
            Wanting to write secure applications got him thinking like a hacker.
            <em>What would I do to break this</em> constantly ran across his mind as he was writing code
            and he soon realized that he enjoys security just as much- if not more- than development.
    Gabe Rust is currently <strike>pursuing</strike> <em>enjoying</em> a career as a security consultant.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
